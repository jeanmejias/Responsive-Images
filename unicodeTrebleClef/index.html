    <p>The treble clef is drawn by starting with a circle in the middle, then going up, round and straight down with a hook at the end.
        <br>The second line of the staff (counting from the bottom) goes through the middle of the treble clef’s circle.
        <br>A note on this line is a G.&nbsp;This is why the treble clef is called a “G clef”.
        <br>The notes higher than Middle C can be written in the treble clef.</p>
