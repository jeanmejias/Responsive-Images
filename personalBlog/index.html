            <p class="lead">I love design, software development, user experience and entreprenuership. ☺ On a personal side, I am an avid foodie, love reading, photography, and helping people. I recently got interested in front-end development. Responsive web design is super cool! Hope you like my blog!</p>

            <p>Horses use their ears, eyes and nostrils to express their mood. They also communicate their feelings through facial expressions. Horses are big fans of water, and will drink a minimum of 25 gallons every single day. In warmer countries, this amount is even higher. When a horse is seen standing up, don’t assume it’s awake! These creatures can sleep either standing up or lying down.</p>
            <p>Horses not only remember people who have treated them well, they also understand words better than expected. Horses are loyal, intelligent and have very long-lasting memories -- of both good and bad experiences.</p>

            <p>Alessandro Volta, an Italian physicist is a pioneer of electrical science who gave his name to the Volt, the unit of electrical force. Volta didn’t speak until he was four years old. Volta was supposed to become either a priest or a lawyer. Despite his delayed speech, Volta became fluent in Italian, German, Latin, French, and English. Volta wrote his first scientific paper at the age of 20. Volta invented the battery while trying to prove someone wrong. Volta didn’t retire until the age of 74.</p>

            <p>Cockatoos are most widely known for the big crests of feathers that they display on the tops of their heads, but there are plenty of other fun and fascinating Cockatoo facts for bird lovers to focus on. For example, did you know that all Cockatoo species hail from Australia? That's right, every single one of these large parrots have origins "Down Under!" If you are interested in learning more about these beautiful and fascinating birds, then keep reading -- some of the surprising Cockatoo facts below might possibly blow your mind!
                <p>
                    <p>Cockatoos, when hand fed as babies and properly tamed, tend to form extremely strong lifelong bonds with their owners. They are also known to be one of the most affectionate parrot species, craving petting from their owners, and preferring to be on or near them at all times. In fact, some Cockatoos can become depressed if they feel like their owners aren't showing them enough attention, and this can lead to side effects such as feather plucking and destructive behavior. For this reason, they are only recommended for those who have a lot of time to devote to handling and socializing with their pets.</p>
                    <p>Over the years, captive pet Cockatoos have been shown to have a propensity for weight gain and obesity if their diets aren't carefully monitored. Because of this, Cockatoo owners are normally encouraged to offer their birds access to minimal seed and a variety of fresh, bird-safe fruits and vegetables instead. In addition to restricted seed intake, Cockatoo owners are sometimes also cautioned to reserve items such as nuts and breads for treats, and refrain from including them in their bird's daily meal offerings.</p>
                    <p>While all parrots can scream, Cockatoos are notoriously loud. Because of their extremely boisterous voices, they are not recommended for people who live in apartments or in otherwise close proximity to their neighbors. A Cockatoo's contact call can be heard for up to a mile or more away, so it's no wonder why they aren't a good choice for small spaces.</p>

                    <p>The French Post Office is known as La Poste. The mailbox appeared in the early 17th century, when the French state founded a service dedicated to safely deliver official reports and orders to its various administrations. These mailboxes are easily recognizable as they bear the official colours of the French Post Office, a dark yellow. Mailboxes have two sections. One side is for letters to be delivered in the local department. The other is for the other departments and abroad - it reads Département and Autres Départements - Etranger.</p>

                    <p>Grasshoppers have ears on their bellies. Although grasshoppers can hear, they can't distinguish pitches very well. Grasshoppers make music by stridulating i.e they rub their hind leg against their forewing or crepitating i.e snap their wings loudly as they fly. Grasshoppers jump by catapulting themselves into the air. Grasshoppers existed long before dinosaurs. Grasshoppers sometimes "spit" brown liquid to defend themselves</p>

                    <p>San Francisco International Airport is the seventh-busiest airport in the US by boarded passengers. The San Francisco International Airport is supported by 267 columns that each rest on a steel ball bearing, allowing the ground to move 20 inches in any direction during an earthquake.</p>

                    <p>These beautiful and noisy birds grow up to about 35 cm long. Whilst they are well known for their bright red feathers, there is a bright yellow subspecies and another subspecies that lives in Adelaide that is more of a yellow to dark orange colour. Crimson rosellas eat seeds from a range of trees, shrubs and grasses as well as tree blossoms and insects. They breed in tree hollows that are lined with wood shavings.</p>
